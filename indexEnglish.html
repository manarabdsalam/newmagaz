    <p class="nn9">The pogrom by Hamas in southern Israel, the largest massacre of Jews since the Nazi Holocaust, has put the reactionary war of Hamas against the Jewish state (October 7, 2023) at the center of the world's attention.<br/><br/>
 
        In the current pogrom, more than 1,200 people, who were engaged in everyday normal life, were massacred in southern Israel; and thousands more were injured. By comparing the population ratio, this number of dead is equivalent to the killing of more than 10,000 ordinary people by bullets within a few hours in Iran and injuring tens of thousands. A pogrom of such proportion is unprecedented in history. </p>
    
    <img src="assets/imgs/2.png" class="img3">
    
    <p>Only one element of Hamas operations is the descent from the air by recreational gliders and the ground (by bulldozing border walls) in the early hours of the morning to kill more than 250 people participating in Supernova music festival near the Gaza border. Another is the killing of dozens of children and adults in several kibbutz, and the abduction of more than 200 children and other family members near the Gaza border who are citizens of many countries. During this criminal operation, Hamas is proud to parade the naked dead body of an Israeli woman they killed in the streets and perform the show of beating her corpse.<br/><br/>

        More than anything else, these events show that a significant part of the Palestinian political movement, and their allies, is into the worst collapse of intellect: Similarly, about Tehran’s demagoguery: how long do you want to continue this obscene propaganda? Doesn’t Islam forbid murder and suicide and the perpetrators go to hell? Why not try for cooperation, reaching over national and religious divides and differences by respecting the right of Israel to exist? Why not strive for equal rights and cooperation between Jews, Palestinians, to achieve freedom and independence, solidarity of oppressed nations, and the rights of nationalities and religious minorities? Contrary to false propaganda, there is striving for unity of Jews and Arabs in Israel.<br/><br/>
        
        The simultaneous realization of the Jewish and Palestinian two-state solution, involving a contiguous Palestinian state, the correct and principled solution seems is no longer supported by the Palestinian leadership factions—indicated by the refusal of the head of Palestinian Authority to condemn Hamas pogrom. Israel was recognized by Yasser Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, in 1993.<br/><br/>
         
        Without the recognition of Israel, no future for the Palestinian factions, and their supporters from Iran to others, can be imagined.<br/><br/>
        
        Before the pogrom, 18,000 people from Gaza came to work in southern Israel every day. Hamas used this achievement of Palestine to plan the pogrom. The perpetrators of this terrible crime then fled to Gaza with a large number of abductees, from children to the elderly.<br/><br/>
        
        With the victory of Hamas in the elections in Gaza (2006), labeling Israel as an apartheid state, and the application of anti-Semitism as the policy of the government, the Palestinian liberation was hit by this reactionary faction. Hamas is the main problem for the Palestinians, not the solution—in the end, Gazans were trapped above miles of tunnels to support Hamas’s reactionary wars against the Palestinians and Israel, and their homes being used to fire explosive projectiles into Israel.<br/><br/>
        
        Hamas should unilaterally stop firing explosive projectiles at Israel and release all kidnapped people and recognize the existence of Israel. Otherwise, the Hamas-Tehran war plan could progress to the complete destruction of Hamas at the cost of killing more Jews in Israel and residents of Gaza. This fact is also true for Lebanon’s Hezbollah, which resorts to firing explosive projectiles against Israeli residents.<br/><br/>
        
        
        <span>        1- Anti-Semitism in the world and Iran
        </span><br/><br/>

        The sad and shameful killing of Jews is lauded. Anti-Semitism is on the rise in the world. The oppression of Palestinians is 70 years old. The oppression of the Jews shows a much deeper and longer history. More than a decade back, Hamas won the election of Gaza (2006) by playing the anti-Semitism, destruction of Israel, card. The result of this reactionary policy finds its peak in the present pogrom.<br/><br/>
        
        Regarding the long history of oppression of Jews: “The first to be eliminated by decaying feudalism, the Jews were also the first to be rejected by the convulsions of dying capitalism. The Jewish masses find themselves wedged between the anvil of decaying feudalism and the hammer of rotting capitalism.”<br/><br/>
          
        Capitalist history does not have a Jewish civil rights movement, like the victorious Blacks civil rights movement against racism in the United States (in the post-World War II era); Therefore, deadly anti-Semitism, now hidden and now apparent, is a part of the daily discourse of the world capitalism. As we can see, Hamas, the perpetrators of the pogrom, are introduced as “resistance” by many, including the media. Hamas’ declaration of “Jihad Day”, which calls for more pogroms, has been translated as “Day of Rage” by central mass media in the United States, and is the theme of demonstrations in support of Hamas in the United States and elsewhere in the world.<br/><br/>
        
        Since the establishment of Israel, the expulsion of nearly 700,000 Palestinians and the 
        beginning of the displacement of Palestinians (1948), the rights of the Palestinian people have been used as an excuse by the anti-Semitic Arab states that never had Palestinian interests in mind. With the establishment of the Shia state in Iran after the 1979 revolution, the same method of abuse was used—from a regime that continues the policy of the former autocratic monarchy and seeks to dominate the Middle East region. In many countries, the anti-Semitic “left” fueled the propaganda of the Tehran-Hamas Shia state and call it “resistance”. They speak in defense of the “revolutionary foreign policy” of the Shia state. As Ardeshir Zahedi, former key diplomat and the close confidant of the deposed Shah for over a quarter of century, also took the stance of support for the Islamic Republic.<br/><br/>
        
        In Iran, the broad political spectrum of the ruling body, from the fundamentalist to the reformist, to the populist and “Left”, and behind them the shahi (supporters of overthrown Shah), generally share anti-Semitic sentiment. Contrary to this attitude, is the celebrated Jalal Al-Ahmad, who traveled to Israel and in his writings praises what he witnesses. Anti-Semitism in Iran is mostly an imported political product of the 20th century from abroad; the ancient history of Asia has both the days of supporting the Jews and suppressing them by Asian despotic rulers at different times. Before the revolution, the royal dictatorship considered itself the central power of the Middle East and had close relations with Israel. The ruling body looked at Israel as its subordinate and the Shah, who acquired his way of thinking since his elementary school years in Europe, on different occasions expressed anti-Semitism.<br/><br/>
        
        After the revolution of 1979, anti-Semitism continued as a general policy of the ruling body: the establishment of the Shia state is based on the pillars of the former system.<br/><br/>
        
         The Shia-Bazaar/capitalist government, following the same path as before, took steps to dominate the region and resorted to Israel bashing and anti-Semitism as the principle of the ruling policy in stronger potions; similar to the positions of Baath in Iraq and Baath in Syria, and many other Arab countries. This policy pursues two goals at the same time: expanding the domination of the Shia state in the region and more importantly, controlling their own people, and imposing a political system of suppression and violence using anti-Semitism. Like Syria, which was under the stifling oppression of Hafez and Bashar al-Assad for many generations under the pretext of fighting against Israel. In fact, none of the repressive regimes in the Middle East have ever been sympathetic to the needs of the Palestinians and are thinking of consolidating the policy of limiting the opportunities as well as suppressing the working classes in their own country.<br/><br/>
        
        Political repressions, especially during the days of “Woman-Life-Freedom”, gives more understanding for the young generation to oppose the Shia state’s anti-Semitism, Israel-bashing, based on their experiences. The slogans of “neither Gaza nor Lebanon, I sacrifice my life for Iran” appeared during the last few years in Iran. In the Middle East among the Sunni Arab population, due to the repression and crimes committed by the Assad dictatorship in Syria, to understand the harms anti-Israelism does is clear for millions more than in other Arab countries.<br/><br/>
        
        Jews should be able to seek refuge in Israel to escape the growing anti-Semitism in the capitalist world. It is not possible to renew the Nazi Holocaust in the 21st century. The plan of the Shia state to suppress the working classes of the region under the banner of anti-Israelism will fail: the existence of the Jewish state will not disappear.<br/><br/>
        
        <span>        2- The immediate and broad background of the pogrom by Hamas and the Shia state’s belligerence in Tehran
        </span>   <br/><br/>      
        The pogrom of Hamas took place due to the process of normalization of Arab countries’ relations with Israel, which Tehran is blocking by instigating war. Just 4 days before the massacre by Hamas, Khamenei (the leader and commander-in-chief of the military forces of the Shia state) in a meeting with the ambassadors of Islamic countries in Tehran (October 3, 2023), expressed his opposition to the normalization of relations with Israel, “warning the Arabs” that “the Zionist regime is going away, they are dying, it will be eradicated,” he said, “don’t bet on a losing horse.”<br/><br/>
          
        With the proxy war of Hamas, Tehran took revenge on the Palestinian people and the people of the Middle East, which is unprecedented in the history of the abuse of the anti-Semitic Arab states before the emergence of the independent Palestinian political movement.<br/><br/>
        
        After the calamity that Tehran brought to Syria by actively supporting Bashar al-Assad dictatorship’s war (from intervention in 2012 onwards), under the slogan of defeating ISIS, now it is Palestine’s turn. But with the massacre of innocent Jewish people, there is no doubt that Hamas and Khamenei/the Shia state in Tehran are the main losers, whether they resort to expand wars in the region or not. Tehran-led successful wars of Shia Napoleon, which have cast a shadow over the Middle East since 2012, have faced an insurmountable obstacle for the first time. At the head of this obstacle are the people of Iran; the majority of Iranian people stay away and oppose anti-Jewish-Israeli propaganda and have sensed it in the suppression by the Islamic Republic.<br/><br/>
        
        The Shia state and its supporters have announced that they are one step away from building an atomic bomb. However, bringing about the Holocaust of the 21st century, is not possible by the expanding anti-Semitism in the world. The military plan of the Shia state in Tehran to dominate the Middle East does not have a chance of success due to a series of historical factors, the demise of Stalinism, the inability of the Bazaar/capitalist government to defeat the working class of Iran. The anti-Sematic consensus of Iran’s ruling body is not a decisive factor. Germany in the 1930s through the counter-revolutionary policy of Stalinism found it possible to defeat the working class, the majority of society, by a small minority of Nazis. Those issues and possibilities for counter-revolution are bygone days of history.<br/><br/>
        
        Russia in north of Iran: Putin’s reactionary aggression against Ukraine (February 24, 2022) broke the Washington-led post-World War II international framework. By starting this war and attacking the independence of Ukraine, it encouraged reaction, anti-Semitism in the world and Jew-killing in the Middle East by Hamas. The usual propaganda of the press of the Shia state in Iran points to the fact that the president of Ukraine is Jewish as a reason for rejecting Ukraine’s independence. Khamenei did not miss the opportunity to announce his full support for Putin’s military aggression during his meeting with him (July 22, 2022).<br/><br/>
        
        If more than four decades ago, Saddam Hussein US-backed war against Iran was a lone action; after Putin’s invasion of Ukraine, the war by semi-colonial states for regional domination is fashion. China sees its interests in expanding its influence in the East Asian/Pacific Ocean region—the Shia state in Tehran is pursuing its expansion in the Middle East. From Turkey to Saudi Arabia, they reach out for expanding their local domination. Everyone is looking for alliances for their own benefit. Iran calls this the triple axis of Russia-China-Iran; In two parts of this triple alliance, that is, Russia (Ukraine) and Iran (Israel), it is soon clear that it has no chance of success. The creation of regional military alliances against Washington is nothing more than imposing the cost of billions of dollars in armament on the hardworking people. It will only promote abject poverty. The way to advance and defend the achievements of the people is the independent organization and action of the urban and rural popular classes, and not the arming of the Shia state program in Tehran. The way to develop peaceful economic relations with all the countries of the world is the correct path required by the interest of peoples.<br/><br/>
        
        Despite the weakening of Washington’s position, the United States is the prime military power in the Middle East and the world and cannot be replaced by other imperial powers or pacts of semi-colonial governments. The way to progress, well-being and dignity is to expand democracy, independent organization of the urban and rural common classes, to achieve Independence and Freedom, and not anti-Semitism and warmongering of the Shia state in Tehran.<br/><br/>
        
        <span>        3- The weakening position of Washington/imperialism with the collapse of the Soviet Union
        </span>  <br/><br/>      
        The events of the last three decades in the Middle East show the weakness of the position of Washington/imperialism, which was strikingly revealed during Putin’s military aggression against Ukraine. Washington weakness indicates increasing since the collapse of the Soviet Union:<br/><br/>
        
        During the last decade of the 20th century, with the collapse of the Soviet Union (December 1991), the position of imperialism under the leadership of Washington has weakened. Imperialism’s trump card since the degeneration of the Soviet Union in the late 1920s, Stalinism, was removed by the Russian people. From this weakened position, Washington used the criminal act of 9-11 in 2001 to occupy Afghanistan and then Iraq. These wars to conquest the two countries finally failed. Iraq after a decade and Afghanistan in two decades. Baghdad was handed over to the Shia militia. Kabul returned to the Taliban. The fate of the two countries that were occupied by Washington remains to be known. Washington’s world standing further weakened.<br/><br/>
        
        The Shia state in Tehran used the breakdowns from Washington’s wars in Afghanistan and Iraq to dispatch Shia militia and spent tens of billions of dollars (Shia state in Tehran has requested $36 billion from Syria as the reimbursement of its war expenses)—to suppress the uprising of the Syrian people and maintain the dictatorship of Bashar al-Assad—under the guise of repelling “ISIS”; an action with the tacit approval of the imperialist powers. With success in Syria, war drum of the military forces of the Shia state in Tehran and the semi-states of the region, the bazaar/capitalist governments, became louder to eliminate Israel, and the number of missiles of the militias, Shia (and Hamas) increased thousands of times. Billions of dollars in Iran’s financial coffers were allocated to military weapons, for two military organizations, the Revolutionary Guards formed by Bazaar and the armed forces left by monarchy, and its wars in the Middle East. Inflation, poverty, and unemployment in Iran multiplied and the standard of living of the majority of people decreased and political suppressions of Shia state increased.<br/><br/>
        
        <span>        4- State and semi-state actors fail to quash the sovereignty of the peoples
        </span> <br/><br/>       
        Along the weakness of imperialism, we see the failure of state and semi-state actors, local bullies, in semi-colonial countries in violating peoples’ rights. The right to self-determination of nations was achieved by the October Revolution of 1917, which led to the establishment of the largest number of new republics, including Ukraine. This inserted headings of the history of humanity since then that cannot be rescinded. It is not surprising: just as Putin has failed in the goal of defeating the independence of Ukraine, Hamas is
        nearing the end because of its pogrom.<br/><br/>
        
        The Middle East has experienced the failure of war plans of state and non-state actors, to varying degrees; state and semi-state actors and the local vigilantes have not been able to cash their bounties in previous rounds of the reactionary wars of Hamas and others and their successes is temporary:<br/><br/>
         
        The ISIS group—the coalition of remnants of Baath and Sunni extremists—in the years 2014 to 2019, conquer many lands and engage in murder, rape, and enslavement of girls and women; ISIS supporters in France murdered Jews, concert hall participants and writers of a satirical magazine. Hamas is bent to outdo the past killing of Jews, but it certainly has no future other than failure.<br/><br/>
         
        Another clear example of this fact is the military intervention of Tehran Shia state in Syria that suppressed the uprising of the Syrian people with the help of bombings of Russian air force and the tacit support of imperial powers. Which “progressive” power, other than Bashar al-Assad’s dictatorship, has torn its own country apart with the help of Tehran’s militias, spending tens of billions of dollars, and Moscow’s air force, has resorted to chemical weapons against its people’s revolution, and has created millions of war refugees. The “victory” of Iran’s Shia state, the suppression of the 2011 revolution in Syria, was made possible at the cost of destroying large parts of civilization in that country. Millions of Syrian refugees were pushed to neighboring countries. The reactionary alliance of Tehran-Damascus did not have sustainable economic, social and political gains.<br/><br/>
        
        If we look back further, the result of Washington’s 21st-century wars, number one economic and military power in the world, was the defeat of the military occupation of Afghanistan (2001-2021) and in Iraq (2011-2003). Going back further, Saddam’s war against Kuwait and the Desert Storm (1990-1991) and before that against the revolution in Iran (1980-1988) either failed or ended up empty-handed.<br/><br/>
         
        Earlier, Moscow’s military intervention in Afghanistan (December 1979 to February 1989) to consolidate the anti-Islamic, “secular”, government in Kabul also failed. This intervention forced reverse migration, from city to village, in Afghanistan. The population of the villages increased tenfold. The Afghan society experienced the most downward trend in its history and fell into a regressive course caused by it. War, the brazen conflict between the city and the countryside became host to imperial powers’ interventions; dominance of village over the city took the place of a semi-colonial setting of city-domineering cooperation between the two, and this retrogressive imposition as a result of Soviet military intervention has continued its impact, through Washington occupation,  for more than 4 decades until today and has shaken the axis of Afghanistan’s development off its hinge. Moscow’s military intervention, and its human and financial costs, played a major role in the collapse of the Soviet Union.<br/><br/>
        
        More than 4 decades of the contingencies of military intervention by the imperial powers and semi-colonial state actors in the Middle East to reject the opportunities of the right to self-determination of the oppressed nations have either failed or ended nowhere.<br/><br/>
         
        The above facts, in Iran, which is going through the of “Woman-Life-Freedom” (Sept. 2022) phase, based on the direct experience of the masses of people with the Shia state in Tehran, and its military-style methods of repression by the Basij-Revolutionary Guards-Police-Security forces, in recent years from brutal killings in Aban 1998 (2019-20) and after, is clear: the Shia state’s intolerance for the assertion of the independent protests of the people against the rising in the price of gasoline, high prices, unemployment, poverty, war, intrusion & violence directed against the rights of women and nationalities.<br/><br/>
         
        This truth was displayed during the “Woman-Life-Freedom” upsurge: continuing to kill or injure protestors in the streets from Zahedan to the rest of Iran arresting tens of thousands, and subsequently executing dozens with baseless charges and pardoning tens of thousands whose prisons did not have the space to hold them, followed by as many as 90,000 pardoned from jail. On the anniversary of “Woman-Life-Freedom”, the same tens of thousands formerly arrested along with members of their families were verbally/phone calls summoned by IRGC intelligence to attend to interrogation and listen to the threats of the IRGC and the security apparatus.<br/><br/>
         
        Action by women, young people, industry workers and mine workers, teachers, retirees and the working class continues for their demands in solidarity with the plight of Woman-Life-Freedom. For the first time after decades, proponents of democracy, such as Maulawi Abdul Hamid in Zahedan, have stepped forward and express the public’s aspirations regarding regional and domestic issues and encourage peaceful solutions and negotiation.<br/><br/>
         
        The insoluble problems of the Shia state, which does not have the support of the majority of the people but the most-exclusive, the million-strong support of its core base among the Shia militias, is obvious.<br/><br/>
        
        <span>        5- The disaster of the rule of Bazaar/capitalist governments and the prospects of independence & freedom to prevent our destruction
        </span>  <br/><br/>      
        The plight of Jewish and Palestinian for unity and freedom in particular, and the quest of the right of oppressed nations to self-determination in general, cannot be lost and exerts themselves more than ever.<br/><br/>
        
        The Bazaar ruling political trends, whether in Gaza or Tehran, be they Sunni or Shia, do not represent the main social force of history. Not being a main force does not preclude the ability to conduct killing and destruction; that is what they seem most capable of. In every step that such forces take, it must rely on one of the main forces, that is, imperialism and the working class. Hamas must rely on being called “resistance” across the world. Institutional anti-Semitism under financial capital uses the existing political agencies of the “national bourgeoisie” for its own interest: More than 70 years of the Arab countries’ anti-Semitism against Israel, serves imperial interest. As indicates presently by the subtext of the main media coverage after the pogrom by Hamas; take the focus away from the pernicious anti-Semitism.<br/><br/>
        
        In Iran, imperialism (coupled with its now mostly deceased reactionary monarchy) and the working class are the historic forces. Due to the weakening of imperialism and the weakness of the independent organization of the working class in Iran, Bazaar politics gets to sway over the country after the revolution of 1979. The main historical forces, i.e. imperial and the working class are the deciders of achieving independence and freedom, to block it by the former and move it forward by the latter. Bazaar and the slew of petty-bourgeois politicians surrounding it, clerical and non-clerical, get to temporarily occupy the political space, to rule from one day to another, without achieving anything substantial; the main achievement, overthrow of monarchy, is behind, and Bazaar politics can only try to undo what has been achieved during their temporary reign; though this temporary time can be long: In Gaza for more than a decade, in Iran for more than four decades.<br/><br/>
        
        Behind the curtain of vicious cruelty by Hamas or the frequent and bloody repressions of the Shia state from Aban of 98 until today, the weakness of the ruling political groups of Bazaar/capitalism, from Gaza to Tehran, is evident.<br/><br/>
         
        In these conditions, the truth of the historical confrontation of imperialism with the working class and its allies among the urban and rural popular classes (URPC), and the need for politics of independent and peaceful action, stand out. Such an approach is necessary for the URPC, to continue on the path of successive generations, and allow for the realization of democratic/capitalist tasks of history to shine.<br/><br/>
         
        The danger is in driving the society suffering from an acute economic, social, political, and cultural crisis coupled with the warmongering of the Shia state, toward the destruction of human civilization by a nuclear war. To avoid such tragedy requires the capable hands of the peoples of Iran to strive to gain Independence and Freedom. Otherwise, Iran’s nuclear military program, which until now, according to the representatives of the Shia state, only needs a few weeks to achieve, will be intensified due to the crises caused by the Shia state.<br/><br/>
         
        <span>        6- The Shia state in Iran: preventing the realization of democratic historical demands by political repressions and squandering the country’s resources on wars and armaments
        </span> <br/><br/>       
        Wherever the action of the peoples, and the urban and rural popular classes is mentioned, history is the stage of progress. Like the revolutionary action to liberate Iran from the back-breaking oppression of royal reaction in 1979. Because of this historical act, the bonds of captivity of the URPC were loosened. Illiteracy went down. Access to higher education increased tenfold with female being the majority of students (despite failure to provide universal free higher education by the Shia state). The separation between the city and the countryside, driven by the policy of reactionary monarchy, was reduced. The economy and society, politics and culture, became more of a social concern, thanks to the revolutionary action of the people. The repression of workers in the factories loosened. The workers were able to come forward and talk about their needs.  A large population of farmers gained access to their agricultural land (despite parts of land reform that remain unfulfilled). The entry of women into society was strengthened (despite the prevention of women’s employment by the Shia state dictums, and its policy of intrusion and violence against women). The voices of  Aghvam, national minorities, which was harshly suppressed under the royal reaction, was heard in the society (despite the Shia state’s prevention of teaching the mother tongues of half of the country’s population). Publishing, libraries, art, music, painting, and film (despite preventing freedom of press,  speech & assembly, publication, and creativity of artists and intellectuals by the Shia state) found unprecedented growth.<br/><br/>
        
        By overthrowing the tyrannical “Shia” shah, the Shia state, due to the weakness of the independent organization of the working class and its many supporters among women, national minorities, religious minorities, farmers, youth/students, small businesses, professionals, artists, and intellectuals, replaced it and this solution was supported by the entire ruling body in Iran and the imperial powers abroad.<br/><br/>
        
        Shia, like many other commodities in Bazaar, was attached to the state by the Bazaar politicians to limit and hinder freedom of speech and assembly. The Shia state is not a historical force of the Iranian society, but an ad-hoc invention of the old ruling classes at the time of the revolution, and its roots go back to the reactionary monarchies of modern history since the time of the constitutional revolution in the early 20th century. The supporters of the Shia state at the time of the revolution were indeed a lot, but no more than a few million at most.<br/><br/>
         
        With the entry of capitalism into the Mahrooseh (guarded) Country of Qajar, at the end of the 19th century, the new force of Bazaar-capitalism—which is qualitatively different from the bazaar in the ancient times—as middlemen of the goods of the imperial powers, grew in the lap of the autocratic monarchy. Its political representatives, both lay and clerical, grew up clinging to the apron of the monarchy. From here, and under the order and direction of preservation of the monarchy, and the support of the colonial powers like Britain, the definition of ruling policy in Iran was declared to be oversight by the Shia over government under the shah. From Naini (Shia scholar) to Khomeini (Grand Ayatollah and founder of the Islamic Republic), the principles of Shia supremacy in the government from the Constitutional Revolution to the 1979 revolution are, more or less, defined and confirmed by the Bazaar politicians and the imperial powers. Anti-clericalism was also promoted from the same source of the reactionary monarchy in conjunction with Shia oversight/supremacy and became the staple of ruling politics.<br/><br/>
        
        In the meantime, since Khomeini had broken the pledge of only playing in the political field of the monarchy during the revolutionary period leading to the 1979 revolution; and had voiced support to the people to overthrow the reactionary monarchy; upon the victory of revolution, all the existing forces of the ruling body and the hierarchy of the bazaar politicians, whether civil or clerical, who were against the revolution and before that were mostly unaware of the Islamic Republic or Velayat al-Faqih, held him responsible and carved for him a position equal to the ousted shah, and simply said that now you have to contain the “vices” of the revolution. The tide of revolution was high and there was nobody else to control it. In this way, all the ruling bodies announced the establishment of the Shia state under Khomeini as the only solution to try to prevent the expansion of the independent organization of the majority of the peoples of Iran who had made the revolution possible.<br/><br/>
         
        With Khomeini’s acceptance (who had gone to Qom seminary for Shia spirituality and elevation) of this new role, the weakness of the independent organization of the working class, and the adverse role of the populist-guerrilla tendencies, historical events became what they became: the people of Iran were left empty-handed and the establishment of the Shia government, as expected, and as we announced at the beginning of the revolution in a live televised debate that was watched by 22 million, became the implementation of “a promise to nowhere.” The opportunity to solve the historic tasks that the many peoples needed to resolve and set aside and open the era of Freedom and Independence in the region, was lost.<br/><br/>
        
        With the overthrow of the reactionary monarchy in 1957, Iran witnessed the blossoming of freedom of expression, assembly, and the possibility of the presence and independent organization of youth, women, workers, farmers, and the many peoples in the country. Socialist weekly “Kargar” (The worker) was published in Iran. The books of Fanus Publications were published. As a result of the revolution, the Shia government, was introduced as the Islamic Republic, which meant that it recognized a role for the people. After 4 years, in the winter of 1361 (1983), as we expected since the victory of the revolution, the Bazaar government, with the cooperation of the imperial powers, began to suppress the independent socialist political trend. This practice was led by the majority of the ruling Mashroote-Mashrooa, that is, the political spectrum of reformists and fundamentalists. Kargar’s publication was banned and afterwards hundreds of published books were destroyed/turned to pulp by the government (1982). The socialist spokesmen were imprisoned without doing anything against the law, and tried for their opinions, and sentenced for the first time to incarcerations for many years.<br/><br/>
         
        Under the Pahlavi reaction, for some time, the show of “Yes” and “Of Course” political parties belonging to the monarchy, as the satire of the day would call them, was performed. When petrodollars poured into Iran in the mid-70s, the royal court could not tolerate its own royalist parties and announced their end and declared the one-party system of Rastakhiz. Moving on the government railings set by the overthrown monarchy by the bazaar government after the revolution the fate of its own “Yes and Of Course” parties proved similar.<br/><br/>
         
        By the end of the Iraq war (1988), the political tendencies of the Bazaar, the “yes” and “of course” political tendencies in the Islamic Republic (fundamentalist and reformist) experienced a period of prosperity. Yet, the bazaar government moving on the government railings set by the overthrown monarchy after the revolution, the fate of Yes and Of Course parties under the Shia state proved the same. This outcome was like the Shah’s times. It reached the non-tolerance of yes and of course parties. The new season of political revival of the peoples of Iran had to bypass the ruling fundamentalist and reformist and emerge, led by women, as Woman-Life-Freedom.<br/><br/>
        
        With the imposition of Bazaar political monopoly, among the central cadre of the Islamic Republic, i.e. many of those who directed or stood aside the suppression of freedom of speech and assembly of the socialist tendency, themselves came to face the bazaar government restrictions, wrath, and exclusion from the country’s political scene up to and including house arrests and incarcerations. With the continuation of the policy of regional domination of the former monarchical reaction by the Shia state in the Syrian war (2012) and the expansion of the Shia militia from Iraq to Lebanon, when the politicians of the Shia state talked about “our” region, the use of military methods in suppressing any protest, any independent expression in economic, political, and cultural fields became common in the country.<br/><br/>
          
        During the past 4 decades of Iran’s history after the 1357/1979 revolution, the Shia state, because of militarizing and preventing the political rights of the Iranian people, (the leaders of the Shia state used the resistance against Iraq’s military aggression to recruit hundreds of thousands of the youth of the generation of 1979 revolution to their militarist agenda—when the social liberation banner of resistance was completely removed in confronting the aggressors—and had them perish by the hundreds of thousands as human waves on the battlefields only to create a new age of capitalist gamble) like preventing the publishing and banning of socialist press, resorting to the long-term imprisonment of socialists, accomplish not a least progressive role in Iranian society in all economic, social, political and cultural domains. No wonder: the rule of the Shia state and its movement was started and continued by basing itself on the tracks set by the former monarchy-imperialism.<br/><br/>
         
        Woman-Life-Freedom showed the need to understand the basic truth and declare the equality of all religions before the state, establishing the historical principle of separation of church-state, which is the universal principle of establishing democracy. The fundamental rights of women and nationality, civil and political rights, were suppressed by the monarchy (first Pahlavi) more than a century ago. With the extinction of the reactionary monarchy (1357/1979), the possibility of obtaining the fundamental rights appeared. It is necessary to establish a democratic regime and set aside the manifestations of the Shia state that prevented the realization of fundamental rights. In Iran, the separation of Shia and the state, and the end of Shia supremacy over the state is necessary—the establishment of a democratic government that relies on civil and political freedoms, the rights of women, nationalities, the freedom of all religions, the independent organization of workers and farmers and all ranks of the urban and rural popular classes now is needed to guarantee survival.<br/><br/>
        
        Through the separation of Shia and state, the people of Iran get to benefit from the achievements of humanity in formulating the principles of freedom in the age of capitalism (as far back as the Bill of Rights towards the end of 18th century in the United States). This achievement points to a government based on the principles of freedom for the majority of the people, the freedom of women, ethnic groups, and the freedom and equality of all religions before the government, from Pakistan to Israel. The independent organizations of the workers, and their allies among the urban and rural popular classes, by adopting the separation of Shia and other religions from the goals of their organizations, makes it possible to provide for the widest unity of the populace allowing to lay the foundation stone for the separation of Shia and state in the society.<br/><br/>
        
        The “ Woman-Life-Freedom” chapter of the history of Iran has now been elevated by the rejection of Jew-killing and anti-Semitism. Today, the completion of the anti-monarchy revolution requires political independence from the bazaar/capitalism. The opportunity for the workers and the urban and rural popular classes to define their needs independent of the bazaar/capitalists and establish a democratic government, a government independent of the bazaar, that is, the government of workers and farmers, is now more than ever before.<br/><br/>

    <h2 class="nnb" id="tfqq">The Short or longer solution</h2>
    <h2 class="ccv">About the Separation of Shia and State in Iran</h2><br/><br/>
    <p>The separation of Shia and the state is one of the main capitalist historic tasks in Iran and it is one of the articles of the Kargar (Worker) Party's program, that we need to explain. It is clear to most of those who know about the situation in the country that the Shia state is not liked by most of the society, to say the least. The performance of the Shia state, for more than four decades, is the main reason of the changing values expectations with regards to government in the country. Those who are not aware of the fundamental changes in people's expectations or deny them, there is no need to read this article. This article assumes the premise of the failure of the Shia state in realizing the general wishes of the people and it seeks to find solutions that are in line with the expectations of the people.<br/><br/>

        The Shia government supporters are in millions today. It is enough to look at the spectrum gathered around the IRGC forces, Basij, police forces, Friday prayers, and other Shia organizations, institutions, and foundations in the country. We can see about several million supporters. The fact is that this minority population is less than 25% of the society—even if it were 100%, it would not change the nature of an unprincipled rule— based on estimate of participation in the previous elections for deciding the head of the executive branch (2021). We can expect further erosion of support since then due to the government’s continued inability to address the peoples’ basic needs and the intensification of the economic, social, political and cultural crisis.
<br/><br/>
       
Big problem occurs by the government’s many million-armed Shia base who consider themselves the country’s “natural” authority and want to use force to “discipline” the rest who are most of the society, against the most intimate concerns of their lives. After the suppression of the Woman Life-Freedom upsurge last year, which resulted in nearly a hundred thousand arrests followed by amnesties, killings in the streets, and scores of executions (in regard to the executions refer to the article “Kargar Party program” and further down in this article), the security officials indicated that now they are ready to suppress a tenfold upsurge of the woman-lifefreedom. How can this harmful “readiness” of the Islamic Republic, to put an end to the social upsurge, be removed and instead to provide the possibility of peaceful cooperation between the government and the people of Iran.
<br/><br/>
        
Solving this problem is better accomplished by the Shia leadership adherence to the people, adoption of the historic capitalist tasks, respecting the rights of youth/students, women, national groups, religious minorities, workers, farmers, professionals, small business owners, artists and intellectuals. In other words, recognition of equal rights for workers on par with the Bazaar/capitalist. But it has been over forty years since the government of Bazaar in Iran has stopped short of these urgent duties and has resorted to the military style suppression, imprisonment (along with executions) of the peoples’ protests. The separation of Shia and state, a key historic capitalist task, opens the possibility to change the government stance and remove the obstacles to the unity of the people; it increases the possibilities to obtain other historic tasks on the agenda.
<br/><br/>
       
       
The separation of Shia and state can be achieved by short or longer solution. A short solution is preferable because it takes less time to achieve. Although it does not have the depth of the longer solution: the short solution is carried out by the governing body. A longer solution is through the independent mobilization of the Iranian people.

<br/><br/>
       
       <span>Governmental solution to the separation of Shia and state
    </span><br/><br/>
       
    The government solution relies on the existing mechanisms in the current government system. To solve the problem of the separation of Shia and state, we can look at the origin of the problem and follow its subsequent evolution, which has caused a strong reaction among the peoples of Iran and look for the solution.
    <br/><br/>
       
    The rules of Shia state, which has ruled Iran for more than four decades, were defined as constitution by the Assembly of Experts of the Constitution, which was formed after the revolution. We can go to this assembly and demand changes in the law. We will be told that this assembly no longer exists, and it has been decades since its closure. The Kargar Party believes, this parliament still exists and can amend its decisions. The Leadership Assembly of Experts, that exists now, is the copy-equal-to-the-original of the Assembly of Experts of the Constitution more than forty years ago.
    <br/><br/>
       
    Many revolutions of modern history define the new social order by election of a Constituent Assembly (Majlis-e Mo’assessan). Revolutionaries usually gather in such an assembly and formulate a new order. Because the issue of establishing a new regime is at stake, they are not afraid of the word Ta’ssiss (establishment) of a new order by a Majlis-e Mo’assessan (parliament of establishers). During the 1979 revolution, Kargar socialist tendency proposal for the convocation of the Constituent Assembly along with the Declaration of the Bill of Rights of Iranian Workers and Toilers was distributed widely. Convocation of the Constituent Assembly was not allowed by Khomeini (Grand Ayatollah, founder of the Islamic Republic) and the bazaar politicians who had gathered around him. The Shia state was defined while preventing the Constituent Assembly from taking place. An assembly which should have been formed by the participation of all who made the revolution possible: the workers of the oil industry and other industries, farmers seeking land, women demanding equal rights with men, representatives of national minorities, minority religions, owners of professions and small businesses, artists and intellectuals and all political tendencies in the country. Instead of the constituent assembly, the Assembly of Constitutional Experts was formed, which is like the existing Assembly of Leadership Experts elected by about half of the electorate.
    <br/><br/>
       
    What kind of assembly was, Majlis-e Khobregan-e Ghanoon Assassi, the Assembly of Constitutional Experts? The chief characteristic of this parliament was that it was composed of about 70 men with a common belief: “I wish the revolution had not taken place” and this fact, if not certainly, but was almost true about all the members of this parliament. The monarchy had fallen due to the revolution. The shah had been ousted from power and defacto law. From the point of view of Bazaar politicians, laws were supposed to be formulated with the least change in the workings of the old system. Not a word to be mentioned about ta’ssiss or mo’assessan (establishing or establishers) of something new and radically different, and thus was the Shia state introduced as the Islamic Republic. We can remedy and fix this basic defect today.
    <br/><br/>
       
    Fortunately, or unfortunately, that Constitutional Assembly of Experts, after closure did not end and continued, and with the same content, composed of believers of “I wish the revolution had not taken place”; it exists today only with a new name: the <em>Assembly of Experts for Leader</em>.
    <br/><br/>
       
    The Assembly of Experts for Leader is composed of a group of high-ranking clerics who know that the situation is not good, and that the Shia state has fallen from the eyes of the Iranian people.<br/><br/>
       
    The Assembly of Experts can correct the wrong. But the Assembly of Experts object that addressing us is mistaken, and that we are only a ceremonial assembly, like the Senate during Pahlavi’s time, we are not in charge of anything, and it is IRGC that controls arms & state! The Kargar Party is aware of this correct objection of the Assembly of Experts. However, it requests the Ceremonial Assembly to issue a ceremonial proclamation to separate Shia and state. To convince the Assembly of Experts of this correct action, which will be unprecedented, exemplary, and well-talked about in the history of ceremonies, we must list the changes caused by the separation of Shia and state, lest we be accused later of hiding from the Assembly of Leadership Experts the truth of the changes caused by this decision.
    <br/><br/>
       
       <span>Shia for its own sake and the government for the sake of the people
    </span><br/><br/>
       
    The separation of Shia and state is based on the historical demand for the separation of the church and state, which enamored human civilization by the end of the 18th century. Therefore, it is not a casual proposal, but it has passed the test of not only more than two centuries but is an enduring achievement of the history of humanity into our future. This is the result of the first successful anti-colonial revolution in history (1776) which took place in North America, which led to the United States, the deepest democracy of the industrial/rich capitalism. Accordingly, in simple words, state can neither encourage religion nor prohibit it, as declared by the First Amendment that states this continuing upon the Freedom of Speech and Assembly—defined in the Bill of Rights (refer readers to the first Article in the Kargar’s party program in this issue). This principle is so clear and obvious that the Assembly of Leadership Experts may feel how late they have come to this simple and clear proposition which was recognized by humanity over 200 years back. But better late than never.
    <br/><br/>
       
       <span>Regarding the changes caused by the separation of Shia and state, we list them from small to big:</span><br/><br/><img src="assets/imgs/3.png" alt="kargar" class="imgx">
        
       Retiring of the Shia from the government; retiring of officials from government positions, from Velayat al-Faqih to organizations under Shia governance and retirement of their government bodies. This is the smallest change. The officials in these positions are generally ready to retire due to old age.
       <br/><br/><img src="assets/imgs/3.png" alt="kargar" class="imgx">
       
       To end allocating state/country’s large financial resources on Shia/Islamic organizations and foundations. This change is good for the Shia organizations, because it forces them to be frugal and removes the free windfall of pouring state monies to their coffers. These huge financial resources allocated to the Shia organizations and foundations can be directed toward food, housing, education, health and employment of vast numbers of people in need.
       <br/><br/><img src="assets/imgs/3.png" alt="kargar" class="imgx">
       
       To end the compulsory Shia education in schools and the entire educational system that was imposed on the country by Pahlavi I and by the British policy since the 1920s. State is not allowed to pay anyone to teach religion. A significant number of teachers of religious education and jurisprudence and the likes, who are currently employed in the education system in the country, will have the opportunity to focus their religious teaching skills in mosques, online, in print, or radio and television programs of the Shia Seminary. The educational system in the country has the duty to provide education for students from childhood to university in their mother tongue and other languages, mathematics, science, technology, literature, arts and sports; universal education needs to be free and without discrimination, ending the current system of dual schools for the rich and schools for the poor, private and state schools. Religious institutions can provide religious teachings through their organizations, independent of the government and without government hindrance. All members of the society can voluntarily benefit from the education of Shia and other religions according to their wishes.

       <br/><br/><img src="assets/imgs/3.png" alt="kargar" class="imgx">
       
           
    Changing of sharia courts from compulsory to voluntary. Shia judiciary can deal with family matters and other sharia concerns of citizens for anyone who volunteers for such ruling; women will not be forced to heed by the decision of such courts as they are not binding; courts without imprisonment and execution; courts, that those Shia adherents who prefer it to regular civil courts can voluntarily refer to—a system that does not have prisons and arrests; Shia judiciary will be relieved from issuing binding verdicts that are contrary to common interests of citizens. Instead of the current Shia judicial system, which competes for the world record in the of executions of prisoners.
    <br/><br/><img src="assets/imgs/3.png" alt="kargar" class="imgx">
       
    Finally, it is the most difficult of all: to fully leave behind the former system of monarchy, which was overthrown through the people’s revolution, and the rights of the nation that after its overthrow were violated and confined to the supremacy of Shia over the state, the continuation of its imposition; ending the legacy of the monarchy. More than forty years ago, the Assembly of Constitutional Experts dealt with the issues from the basis of I-whish-there-was no-revolution. Now the Assembly of Leadership Experts announces the separation of Shia and state, the new basis of the law, that gives the authority of the people to the people, and issuing the finality of separation, i.e., the complete cutting off of relations with the former autocratic monarchy, through the separation of Shia and state. (Shia became state religion by the Shia Safavid tribes who ruled the Safavid country during the 17th century and continued by subsequent tribal monarchies who defined or changed their politics by designation of religion; in old history religion was equivalent of politics. Picked upon and continued by 1st Pahlavi and imperial British concoctions was Shia as official religion and Farsi as the official language as definition of ‘modern’ Iran in 1920s; when the people had become the basis of politics and politics had become independent of religion, when the participation of people in the Constitutional Revolution in the early 20th century was also the time of proclamation of the equality of all languages. The legacy of Stalinism and the defeat of 28 of Mordad [1953 CIA coup d’état] was the main reason for the supremacy of Shia over politics in the aftermath of revolution of 1979).
       
    In this manner, the Assembly of Leadership Experts can help the people with a ceremonial proclamation to help resolve the current crisis, which is known to everyone.

    <br/><br/>
       
       <span>The longer solution 
    </span><br/><br/>
       
    The longer solution to separate Shia and state. If the Shia authorities and dignitaries do not heed to the peoples’ wishes, there will be no other way but to fulfill the democratic/capitalist historical demands by the people. Upon this path, the fulfillment of these demands starts from the range and progress to the conquest of the peak.
    <br/><br/>
       
    The peaceful struggles of the popular urban and rural classes lead to the emergence of their independent organizations around their demands and through the broadest unity among the ranks of the nation, requires the inclusion of all. In these organizations, the charter is based on the demands of the peoples, the needs of the peoples, and the broadest unity of all; the charter of these organizations are naturally separated from religions by focusing on core demands that unites everyone. Much like the movement of working classes in industrial countries of Europe whereby Christian workers started to set aside their religion when they adopted charters for their unions during the 19th century. The popular movement of the people around their demands attracts all their sons and daughters among the current military forces of the Shia government to their side. The longer solution cannot be blocked due to the aspirations of progress, independence, freedom, dignity, and common wisdom.
 
    <br/><br/>
        
    It is better that the Shia wisemen take steps to meet the need for the separation of Shia and state. And in this way deepen their bond with the people more than ever in the past.

Women must be shielded by the government from male family members, friends, brothers, and any other violent men.

The country is like a family of nations and is like a prison without the full right of nationalities to their independence from the country-family as a result of historical and contemporary national oppression (in the past instituted by the Pahlavi autocracy and imperial Britain, 1920s, and maintained by the Shia state). This right is comparable to a woman’s right to divorce from an oppressive marriage; in the absence of that right, a marriage is a prison.

    <h2 class="khlass" id="skhn">A Note to our Readers:
    </h2>
    <p>This issue of Kargar is published forty years after it was banned, during which time we were imprisoned and later exiled. At the beginning it is important to acknowledge the contributors; Almanar who created the layout and visuals, and the name of the authors and translators of each piece appears with each article.This issue of Kargar is published forty years after it was banned, during which time we were imprisoned and later exiled. At the beginning it is important to acknowledge the contributors; Almanar who created the layout and visuals, and the name of the authors and translators of each piece appears with each article.<br/><br/>
 
This new volume of Kargar is being released in three languages: Farsi, Arabic, and English. The Farsi journal has a link to the Arabic and English language. We feel compelled to let the voice of Iran's toilers and workers be heard by the Arab speaking populations, because of the war programs of the Shia state to dominate the mostly Arab speaking Mid-East region and the minority Arab population of Iran, which is a part of Khuzestan—called Arabistan until the early 20th century. The majority of Iranians support solidarity among the peoples and are against regional domination. Based on this, we also issue Kargar in Arabic.<br/><br/>

Regarding the translated articles in Kargar, the reader will be referred to its origin in the original language if the English, Farsi, or Arabic are available. For instance, the reader can locate the original texts of Marx and Engels' writings that are currently available in Farsi, Arabic, and English. In the future, we'll make an effort to include, at the very least, an English summary of the articles. The Arabic and Farsi versions will be the same. We are grateful to everyone who helps publish Kargar in Farsi, Arabic, and English.<br/><br/>

A note regarding referring “names” in the articles: Every person discussed in this journal is treated equally. A person's first and last names are used to identify them. The first time the person's name is mentioned it includes any title they may have. “Ruhollah Khomeini”, “The Grand Ayatollah” and founder of the Islamic Republic, is one example, from then on he will be referred to as “Khomeini”. The term “doctor” will not be applied to the individuals listed unless they are medical professionals; instead, the titles or positions they have held will be mentioned first, followed by their name as an acronym; for example, Mehdi Bazargan (textile engineer, leader of the provisional government, organizer of Nehzat-e Azadi), and later referred to as Bazargan or M.B.<br/><br/>

In the two earlier volumes of Kargar, that were published in Iran thanks to the 1979 revolution, given the strong anti-Americanism generally espoused by Bazaar politicians, Kargar refers to the “United States” instead of “America”. This approach will be followed in the new volume, with the exception of citing from other people or articles, in which case the original will be used.<br/><br/>

The horrific slaughter carried out by Hamas in southern Israel is the main topic of this third volume’s new issue. The Kargar Party’s summary program, and the separation of Shia and state are two additional crucial subjects that are also published here. Along with Our Opinion.<br/><br/>

Numerous queries concerning the past, present, and future are brought up by the articles in this issue:<br/><br/>

How were the Jews treated in the ancient history and during capitalism? How did Islam appear in history? In 1979, how was the Islamic Republic (IR) founded? What did IR pioneers think, and how did the society they were raised in shaped their ideas? When did the ruling reformism and fundamentalism, known in history as Mashroote and Mashrooa, come into being in modern history?<br/><br/>
 
How should a person study history? Many history books are seen by readers as revelations; however, isn’t it better to investigate the hows and whys of the historical events that are absent from the majority of academic publications? What was the history of Asia and how was it distinct from the history of Europe? What was the process by which capitalism evolved in the West? Why is dialectical reasoning, comprehending historical materialism important? With the ruling class hype about “Danesh Bonyan”, “Basic knowledge”, what is the role of technology in modern society?<br/><br/>

How was the cosmos defined in human history? What were the world’s primitive religions like? How come the majority of the Abrahamic religions in antiquity, originated in the Middle East? In what ways are the literary works of Farsi and Arabic distinct from the classical Hellenic literature in light of these distinctions?<br/><br/>

If we go back deeper in time, how did the human species acquire the ability to think and comprehend? And how did idealism give rise to materialism after countless millennia of existence?<br/><br/>

Finally, in this era of Woman-Life-Freedom, where does the oppression of women historically originate from? How did the institution of marriage, that currently is a paramount hardship today’s youth face, come to be? Where did polygamy and monogamy originate? How did the marital business come into play?<br/><br/>

In the upcoming Kargar issue, we will address each of these queries along with a host of others.<br/><br/>

Furthermore, we believe it is imperative to honour the 54-year history of Kargar socialists who have battled for Independence and Freedom, the liberation and autonomy of our peoples. What is the basic role of the correct and independent socialist political program? How was this way of thinking achieved, and why do our politics begin with the world? How did our perspectives improve upon historical events that we witnessed? How has our knowledge of Iran’s past expanded? Why was the only way for the autonomous Kargar socialist politics to evolve and still is the maintenance of a line of demarcation and a principled confrontation with the numerous Stalinist/Maoist, Jebheh Melli/bourgeois nationalist, populist/guerrilla, and middle-class Left tendencies?<br/><br/>

Principled unification with heterogeneous currents is necessary for the organization of independent socialist current. In the contrary case(s) of unity, how did we handle unprincipled splits (that primarily hurt those who resorted to such action)? What is the process of debate and opinion sharing that we have followed for more than fifty years, and how is an organization based on principled politics different from the vertical organizations of the petty bourgeoisie? How were the primary responsibilities in relation to the defence of civil and political liberties, the defence of political prisoners during the reactionary Pahlavi reign by the Committee for Artistic and Intellectual Freedom in Iran (CAIFI) carried out—as well as, the subsequent campaign for “legal” activity, the ongoing defence of imprisoned socialists by the Islamic Republic, the defence of minority religions, and against the detention of workers? Why is total political independence necessary for our conception of international cooperation, and how did/do we defend ourselves against disruptions along the protracted path of propagating the independent socialist viewpoint?<br/><br/>

Similar to the questions pertaining to ancient and modern history, knowing the background of independent socialist Kargar politics offers a deeper comprehension of how to organize the revolutionary workers movement. Our objective is for the younger workers, to discover the solutions to the aforementioned queries in Kargar’s upcoming and future editions. The questions listed for the upcoming issues appear to be quite difficult. We’ll try our hardest to address every one of these queries in the upcoming edition. The benefit of publishing Kargar also lies in its subsequent issues, which facilitate ongoing discourse and viewpoint sharing.<br/><br/>

Which subjects are absent from Kargar? This paper is not for you if you support the military invasion of Iran by Washington or the sanctions imposed on it in conjunction with its imperial allies, or if you read articles in other journals that advocate for cleric bashing, Islamic/religious fascism, or designate the clerical counterrevolution for Iran. Kargar is unwavering in its support of Iran’s right to self-determination and religious freedom. It sees religious freedom as an extension of its own freedom because it understands that achieving Independence and Freedom depends on defending the right to free speech and assembly. This awareness we foster among youth, women, workers, and society of all urban and rural popular classes. Cleric-bashing is a game being played in the domain of the toppled monarchy; it is the repetition of liberal/petty bourgeois prejudice. Many who employ terms like “clerical-counterrevolution” and similar ones, or those who search for clerics in the old history (Shahi’s area of expertise) or who identify its “class” basis in that history (the area of expertise of petty bourgeois intellectuals, in compliance to Shahi) are unaware of the arena in which they are operating. The independent politics of the urban and rural popular classes constitute our political arena.<br/><br/>

For readers familiar with Farsi literary metaphor constructions, Kargar makes every effort to minimize the use of metaphor, even though poem and poetry are highly esteemed. We make an effort to constantly communicate in an approachable, straightforward, and basic manner. Our politics is cognizant of the primacy of the world and class society, and we offer our opinions with due respect for the opinions of other classes, especially bazaar politicians. We clearly convey the Kargar Party’s proposals, which we aim to expand and organize. Our goal is to succeed in this quest.<br/><br/>

After reading Kargar, the reader is persuaded that this publication—like the first years of its publication as a result of the revolution—must be published and be available on the newspaper stands for all readers, like any other journal in Iran. Sure, we intend to attempt publishing Kargar in Tehran. After reading Kargar, we hope that the Shia state in Iran will permit its lawful publication and not miss the chance to engage in constructive and fruitful criticism within the community. We hope to revive the Fanus Publication followed by the socialist journal’s publication, and we hope Shia state permits that as well.<br/><br/>

Due to the Shia state’s policies, we hope that the peoples of Iran and the Middle East will firmly resist the threat of mass destruction and achieve Independence and Freedom.<br/><br/>

        <span class="blue">Defending the existence of Israel: the road to Independence and Freedom of Iran.
        </span><br/><br/>
        More than four decades ago, the victory of the 1979/1357 Iran’s revolution carried the promise of Iran's Independence and Freedom. Unfortunately, this promise was never fulfilled due to the establishment of a Bazaar government under the leadership of Khomeini (Grand Ayatollah, the founder of the Islamic Republic): Shia state was established as the Bazaar solution and this was accepted by imperial powers—and continued under the leadership of Khamenei (second Velayat Faqih).
            <br/><br/>
        
        The Bazaar government not only failed to fulfill the promise of the historical desires of the nation, but by suppressing the independent socialist tendency in the winter of 1983/1361, banning Kargar magazine, Fanus publications and arresting and imprisoning socialist spokespersons, during the Iraq war of invasion, it became an obstacle to the establishment of Independence and Freedom of Iran—instead of creating opportunities for victory in Iraq war by committing to the historic democratic tasks, hundreds of thousands of the young generation of revolution perished in the war fields under the political leadership of Bazaar.

            <br/><br/> 
        
            Over time, Shia state went beyond the fundamental clampdown in Iran by resorting to the wars of Shia Napoleon since the suppression of the 2011 Syrian revolution with the cooperation of Moscow, and appeared as a barrier against the independence and freedom of the peoples of the region—military style suppression in Iran became Shia state fashion. The outcome of Tehran's victory in the Syrian civil war and the expansion of Shia militias from Iraq to Lebanon, etc. is followed by targeting the destruction of Israel. This paved the way for Hamas's pogrom, the killing of nearly 1,200 Jews on October 7, 2023. The war background to Hamas pogrom is Putin's criminal invasion of Ukraine on February 24, 2020. 
            <br/><br/>
         
            More than 200 people of Israel were kidnapped during this pogrom, and they are imprisoned in the tunnels of Hamas without anyone knowing their fate, nor international bodies such as the United Nations or the Red Cross request visiting them. The purpose of this proxy war on the part of Tehran is to eradicate the Jewish communities and put to stifle the quest for independence and freedom in Iran and the entire Middle East region.
            <br/><br/>
        
            The Bazaar government in Iran is not a historical force nor has an independent historic role. From today to tomorrow, it makes its function possible by relying on either of the two confronting main forces of history, that is, the Iranian working class and imperialism, the latter under the leadership of Washington—one day relying on the nation and another day relying on imperialism is the crutch of the Bazaar-Shia government.
            <br/><br/>
        
            Relying on the peoples by the Bazaar government with bloody suppression since November 2018 and then repression, arrest, and execution during the renewed political life of Iran, thanks to woman-life-freedom, has basically disappeared. What remains is the hollow propaganda of the ruling establishment and the support of a few million government, security and military ranks of the Shia state.<br/><br/>

            Reliance on imperialism persists with its growing contradictions of support and sanctions: during Israel’s pursuit of criminal Hamas in Gaza, to put an end to more pogroms, the imperialist establishment has defocused from the unprecedented pogrom of Jews and focused propaganda on Gaza’s devastation or death—images of devastation and sometimes painful death for which Hamas is fully responsible shows the main fodder of the mass media being under the direction of financial capital.
            <br/><br/>
         
            International supporters of Hamas promote a “ceasefire” to preserve Hamas. This kind of false propaganda has enhanced the emergence of anti-Semitic street demonstrations, as well as threats and assaults on Jewish citizens by Hamas supporters especially in the United States and Europe and other countries. But the program of imperialism will not get anywhere from these manipulations and false propaganda. What is clear is that, as in the 20th century, the fight against anti-Semitism is one of the fundamental principles of the struggle for national liberation and labor organization in the world. It is not possible to repeat the Nazi holocaust by the current reactionary tendencies. The defeat of anti-Semitism and its international supporters is inevitable in the 21st century: Humanity can avoid annihilation of the World War III by victory over capitalism/imperialism.

            <br/><br/>
        
            The urban and rural popular classes in Iran, with their sharp instinct that they have gained by the repressions of the Shia-Bazaar government, distinguish between right and wrong and oppose Jew-killing and anti-Semitism. Opposing anti-Semitism at the same time is support to their own rightful demands. The spread of poverty in the country will intensify due to the economic, social, political, and cultural crisis caused by the Bazaar rule, and the peoples’ efforts to defend their existence will intensify.
            <br/><br/>
        
        
            The way to help the urban and rural popular classes in the Middle East region is to oppose the Bazaar-Shia policy in Iran and raise the flag of Independence and Freedom in the region by defending the existence of Israel. The path to Iran’s Independence and Freedom passes through the defense of Israel’s existence.

                <br/><br/>
        

        
            <span class="blue">        The need to correct China’s policy in the Middle East and emphasize the defense of Israel’s existence.
            </span>  <br/><br/>      
            Putin’s military aggression against Ukraine encourages the rise of local warlords in international politics. By breaking the post-WWII international framework led by Washington through Moscow’s aggression against Ukraine, the promotion of the false hypothesis of a unipolar world leads to the promotion of the false hypothesis of a multipolar world, such as the axis of Russia, China, Tehran, etc. The fact is that local wars, such as Moscow against Ukraine, Hamas against Israel, etc., is a fire that can claim the new claimants of global power. Among these contenders, China, as the world’s second economy, can play a significant role in righting the wrong. At the time of revolution of 1979 China stood with the Pahlavi autocracy and had no choice but the amend its position with the victory of revolution. Currently, China avoids a principled position of defense of Israel existence and along with Moscow instead of condemning the pogrom and its recurrence speaks of defense of Hamas under the guise of prevention of destruction of Gaza. Middle East and the world need Beijing to express a principled policy against local warlords.<br/><br/>

            In the Middle East, China is a buyer of energy resources and, like the rest of the world, a seller of many goods. China is a buyer of oil and gas from Saudi Arabia to Qatar and Tehran, etc. It is to secure these resources that China started the positive initiative of cooperation between Tehran and Riyadh (Spring 2023). China’s positive initiative in cooperation with Middle East countries will work when it publicly encourages these countries to cooperate with Israel and does not shy away from the principles of peace and defense of Israel’s existence under the pretext of economic interests. China can accomplish this goal by making energy purchases along with public persuasion for recognition of Israel by the oil and gas-rich states of the region, thereby isolating Hamas and helping to silence the drumbeat of anti-Semitic warmongering in the Middle East. The global reality shows the diversity of oil and gas fields, which is not limited to the Middle East, and therefore there is no economic obstacle in expressing China’s principled opinion.<br/><br/>
            
            China’s common status with the semi-colonial countries of the Middle East increases the chances for the positive effect of China’s correct stance. Behold the Middle East of Hamas supporters: Qatar, a country with billions of dollars of wealth obtained from energy exports, is an ally and a supporter of Hamas from 2000 kilometers away. Saudi Arabia is almost the same distance as Qatar from Israel, and a fervent supporter of “cease-fire” while refusing to establish diplomatic relations with Israel. More strikingly, Tehran supports Hamas and shouts for the destruction of Israel. These group of oil-producing countries do not shy away from the tragedy of supporting Hamas and use it to shut the political space in their country. China needs to add the defense of Israel’s existence parallel to the deal with oil and gas exporters in the Middle East, and in this way, use the huge economic opportunities it has obtained through cooperation with the imperial finance capital for the benefit of the people and world peace.<br/><br/>
            
            China’s lack of a principled position in the Middle East pushes Beijing to become more hegemonic in the Pacific region—China can say that it is repeating the principles used by imperialism for many decades: Washington and London and other imperial allies did foster cooperation and continue to do so with the anti-Semitic governments, the oil and gas exporters of the Middle East, for decades since the establishment of Israel. The application of these principles by China now will have the same results as it did before for the imperial powers but its harmful results can appear much faster.<br/><br/>
             
            With the breakup of the post-WWII international order the worse thing one can do is to appear as a “local bully”. This truth is evident in the tragedy of Russia’s murderous invasion of Ukraine.<br/><br/>
             
            Not taking a principled position in the Middle East will push China to appear more and more to seek the domination of the Pacific region—which is a prescription for disaster in waiting. Meanwhile, China wants to connect to Europe through the “Belt and Road Initiative”. The path of the Belt and Road initiative goes through the defense of Israel’s existence.<br/><br/>
